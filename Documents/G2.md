### 2022 GUIDELINES ON THE REFERENCE LINES FOR USE WITH OPERATIONAL
CARBON INTENSITY INDICATORS (CII REFERENCE LINES GUIDELINES, G2)

1  Introduction

1.1  These Guidelines provide the methods to calculate the reference lines for use with operational carbon intensity indicators, and the ship type specific carbon intensity reference lines as referred to in regulation 28 of MARPOL Annex VI.

1.2  One reference line is developed for each ship type to which regulation 28 of MARPOL Annex VI applies, based on the specific indicators stipulated in 2022 Guidelines on operational carbon intensity indicators and the calculation methods (G1) developed by the Organization, ensuring that only data from comparable ships are included in the calculation of each reference line.

2  Definition

2.1  MARPOL  means  the  International  Convention  for  the  Prevention  of  Pollution  from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocols of 1978 and 1997 relating thereto, as amended.

2.2  IMO DCS means the data collection system for fuel oil consumption of ships referred to in regulation 27 and related provisions of MARPOL Annex VI.

2.3  For  the  purpose  of  these  Guidelines,  the  definitions  in  MARPOL  Annex  VI,  as amended, apply.

2.4  An  operational  carbon  intensity  indicator  (CII)  reference  line  is  defined  as  a  curve representing the median attained operational carbon intensity performance, as a function of Capacity, of a defined group of ships in year of 2019.

3  Method to develop the CII reference lines

3.1  Given the limited data available for the year of 2008, the operational carbon intensity performance of ship types in year 2019 is taken as the reference.

3.2  For a defined group of ships, the reference line is formulated as follows:

ùë™ùë∞ùë∞ùíìùíÜùíá = ùíÇùë™ùíÇùíëùíÇùíÑùíäùíïùíö‚àíùíÑ (1)

where CII_ref is the reference value of year 2019, Capacity is identical with the one defined in the
specific  carbon  intensity  indicator  (CII)  for  a  ship  type,  as  shown  in  Table.  1;  a  and  c  are
parameters estimated through median regression fits, taking the attained CII and the Capacity
of individual ships collected through IMO DCS in year 2019 as the sample.

4  Ship type specific operational carbon intensity reference lines

The  parameters  for  determining  the  ship  type  specific  reference  lines,  for  use  in Eq.(1), are specified as follows:
